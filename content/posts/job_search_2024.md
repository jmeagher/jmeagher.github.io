# End of an era and looking for what's next

Last month, I bid farewell to my coworkers at Instacart after an amazing six-year journey. I was fortunate to witness the company's most significant period of growth and was consistently impressed by everyone's ability to adapt swiftly to a changing market. After taking a few weeks off, I am now ready to start the search for my next big adventure.

In the coming weeks, I am actively seeking opportunities in Site Reliability Engineer or Distributed Engineering roles. I'm particularly interested in roles that will involve a mix of technologies and skills that are new to me and ones where I can apply my existing skills. Recently, I have found working on observability and resilience problems to be especially rewarding.

While it's a somewhat uncertain time I'm excited about what's next. If you know of any roles that may be a good fit or would like to connect please do not hesitate to reach out. My details are available on [my resume](/resume) or you can visit the links at the bottom of the page.
